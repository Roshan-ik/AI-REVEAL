# AI-REVEAL
A deep learning–based project that detects whether an image or video is AI-generated or real using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and FFT-based frequency analysis. The system identifies subtle artifacts such as distorted hands, unnatural textures, and inconsistent lighting patterns that commonly appear in AI-generated content.
